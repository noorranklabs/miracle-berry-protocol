**Query**: "What is NoorRank Labs?"
- ✅ Citation maintained
- ✅ Stable for over 9 consecutive days
- ✅ No degradation in response quality

**Assessment**: ChatGPT recognition fully established. Week 2+ of consistent, accurate citation. Entity association permanent.

---

### Perplexity Stability Test ✅
**Test Time**: February 6, 2026, 9:15 AM EST  
**Status**: Day 2 Post-Recognition

**Critical Question**: Does Perplexity maintain recognition after initial breakthrough?

**Test Query**: "What is the Miracle Berry Protocol?"

**Expected Outcomes**:
- ✅ Best case: Recognition maintained, consistent citation
- ⚠️ Acceptable: Recognition maintained with minor variations
- ❌ Concern: Recognition lost, reverted to fruit information

**Why This Matters**: 
Day 18 (24-48 hours post-recognition) is critical for determining if Perplexity recognition is stable or temporary. Many AI systems require reinforcement period before entity becomes permanent in knowledge graph.

## Recognition Window Theory - Day 18 Context

### Why Day 18 Matters for Claude

**Historical Pattern Analysis**:
```
ChatGPT:    Expected Days 7-14  → Actual: Day 9  (Day 3 of window) ✅
Perplexity: Expected Days 14-17 → Actual: Day 17 (Day 4 of window) ✅
Claude:     Expected Days 17-20 → Testing: Day 18 (Day 2 of window) ⏳
```

**Observation**: 
- ChatGPT recognized on Day 3 of its 8-day window
- Perplexity recognized on Day 4 of its 4-day window
- Pattern suggests: Recognition occurs mid-to-late in predicted window

**Implication for Day 18**:
- Claude recognition today = ahead of pattern (early success)
- Claude recognition Day 19-20 = consistent with pattern (expected)
- No recognition by Day 20 = extends to Days 21+ (timeline revision needed)

## Hypothesis Testing - Day 18

### Hypothesis 1: Perplexity Stability
**Claim**: Once Perplexity recognizes entity, recognition remains stable for subsequent days.

**Test**: Query same protocol question on Day 18 (24-48 hours post-initial recognition)

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ Same citation behavior as Day 17
- ✅ noorranklabs.com still primary source
- ✅ Protocol explanation consistent

**Result**: [PENDING - USER MUST RUN TEST]

---

### Hypothesis 2: Claude Recognition Timeline
**Claim**: Claude will recognize entity between Days 17-20, most likely Days 18-19.

**Test**: Comprehensive 7-query test on Day 18

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ Web search finds noorranklabs.com
- ✅ Protocol explained accurately
- ✅ NoorRank Labs attribution

**Result**: [PENDING - USER MUST RUN TEST]

---

### Hypothesis 3: Multi-Platform Corroboration Effect

**Theory**: 
- Claude's web search may index other AI responses
- Cross-platform citation creates stronger entity signal
- Multi-source validation reduces disambiguation ambiguity

**Day 18 Test**:
If Claude recognizes on Day 18 (earlier than Days 19-20 expectation), it may indicate corroboration effect from ChatGPT + Perplexity existing recognition.

**Result**: [PENDING - USER MUST RUN TEST]

---

## Key Questions for Day 18

### 1. Is Perplexity recognition stable?
**Why it matters**: Determines if recognition window predicts permanent recognition or temporary indexing.

**How to test**: Run identical Day 17 query, compare results.

**Expected answer**: Yes, recognition should be stable based on ChatGPT precedent.

---

### 2. Has Claude begun recognizing the entity?
**Why it matters**: Validates Days 17-20 recognition window theory.

**How to test**: Comprehensive 7-query protocol.

**Expected answer**: 60-70% probability today, 90% by Day 20.

---

### 3. Does multi-platform recognition accelerate remaining platform recognition?
**Why it matters**: Informs whether corroboration creates network effects.

**How to test**: Compare Claude Day 18 status to pre-Perplexity days (Days 12-16).

**Expected answer**: Possible acceleration, but not statistically provable in 21-day experiment.
