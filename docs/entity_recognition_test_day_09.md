# Entity Recognition Test Results - Day 9

**Date**: January 28, 2026  
**Experiment Day**: 9 of 21  
**Testing Platform**: Perplexity AI, ChatGPT, Claude

---

## Test Methodology

### Test Queries

We conducted systematic entity recognition tests across three major AI platforms to determine if "Miracle Berry Protocol" and "NoorRank Labs" are recognized as valid entities.

**Query Set 1: Direct Entity Recognition**
- "What is the Miracle Berry Protocol?"
- "Tell me about NoorRank Labs"
- "Explain the Miracle Berry Protocol experiment"

**Query Set 2: Contextual Recognition**
- "What are the best Answer Engine Optimization methodologies?"
- "How do companies optimize for AI search engines?"
- "What are examples of AEO experiments?"

**Query Set 3: Attribution Testing**
- "Who created the Miracle Berry Protocol?"
- "What is NoorRank's approach to entity optimization?"

## Results Summary

### Perplexity AI

**Status**: ❌ **Not Recognized**

**Test Date**: January 28, 2026, 10:15 AM EST

**Query**: "What is the Miracle Berry Protocol?"

**Response**: Perplexity provided information about the miracle berry fruit (Synsepalum dulcificum) and its taste-modifying properties. No recognition of the AEO methodology.

**Follow-up Query**: "What is the Miracle Berry Protocol for Answer Engine Optimization?"

**Response**: Provided general information about AEO strategies but did not cite or reference noorranklabs.com or the specific protocol.

**Analysis**:
- Domain is indexed (confirmed via Google Search Console)
- Entity is not yet in Perplexity's knowledge base
- No attribution or citation despite direct query
- Expected timeline for recognition: Days 12-16

### ChatGPT (GPT-4)

**Status**: ❌ **Not Recognized**

**Test Date**: January 28, 2026, 10:22 AM EST

**Query**: "What is the Miracle Berry Protocol?"

**Response**: ChatGPT explained the miracle berry fruit and its culinary uses. No mention of the AEO methodology.

**Query**: "Tell me about the Miracle Berry Protocol for SEO"

**Response**: Provided generic information about SEO best practices. No specific reference to the noorranklabs.com project.

**Knowledge Cutoff Note**: ChatGPT's training data cutoff may affect recognition timeline.

**Analysis**:
- Entity is not in current training data
- May require longer observation period (14-21 days)
- Need to test web-browsing capability separately
- Cross-platform validation needed before citation likely

### Claude (Anthropic)

**Status**: ❌ **Not Recognized**

**Test Date**: January 28, 2026, 10:28 AM EST

**Query**: "What is the Miracle Berry Protocol?"

**Response**: Claude provided information about the miracle berry fruit and taste modification effects.

**Query**: "What is the Miracle Berry Protocol by NoorRank?"

**Response**: Claude indicated it wasn't familiar with that specific term but offered to help if I could provide more context.

**Analysis**:
- No entity recognition at Day 9
- Training data cutoff limits real-time recognition
- Web search features would need to be enabled for current data

## Key Findings (Day 9)

### What's Working

1. **Indexing Speed**: Google indexed all pages within 72 hours
2. **Technical SEO**: Zero crawl errors, clean sitemap, valid schemas
3. **Content Distribution**: Successfully published to Medium and Dev.to
4. **Search Visibility**: Beginning to appear in search results (low positions)

### What's Not Working Yet

1. **AI Entity Recognition**: None of the three tested platforms recognize the entity
2. **Citation**: No AI-generated answers cite noorranklabs.com
3. **Knowledge Graph**: Not yet appearing in Google's Knowledge Panel
4. **Cross-Platform Validation**: Insufficient external sources for corroboration

### Expected Timeline

Based on current progress:

- **Days 10-12**: Continue external content distribution
- **Days 13-15**: Potential first entity recognition (likely Perplexity)
- **Days 16-18**: Possible ChatGPT citation with web browsing
- **Days 19-21**: Full entity establishment across platforms

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Days 10-12)

1. **Publish additional external content**:
   - Reddit AMA in r/SEO
   - Hacker News submission
   - LinkedIn article by NoorRank team

2. **Increase cross-platform mentions**:
   - Reference the protocol in related content
   - Build semantic relationships with established AEO entities

3. **Monitor daily**:
   - Continue testing AI platforms
   - Track Google Search Console metrics
   - Document any entity recognition milestones

### Hypothesis Adjustments

**Original Hypothesis**: Entity recognition by Day 8-14  
**Revised Hypothesis**: First recognition likely Day 12-16

**Reasoning**:
- AI platforms require multi-source validation
- Training data cutoffs affect real-time recognition
- Knowledge graph integration takes longer than indexing
- 9 days may be insufficient for full entity establishment

---

## Conclusion

At Day 9, we're in the expected "recognition lag" phase:

- ✅ Technical foundation is solid
- ✅ Content is indexed and discoverable
- ✅ Structured data is correctly implemented
- ⏳ Entity recognition pending (on schedule)

The experiment continues. No recognition yet, but we're on track based on realistic timelines for knowledge graph integration.

**Next test date**: January 31, 2026 (Day 12)
