3. Direct noorranklabs.com search in Perplexity

**Priority 2: Monitor for Indexing Signals**
- Check if Perplexity shows noorranklabs.com in ANY results
- Look for partial recognition (site appears but not as primary answer)
- Note any changes from Day 12/15 tests

**Priority 3: Continue ChatGPT Verification**
- Ensure citation remains stable
- Test new query variations
- Document consistency

### If Day 15 Tests Showed Perplexity Recognition

**Priority 1: Stability Testing**
- Retest same queries from Day 15
- Verify recognition persists
- Test different query formulations

**Priority 2: Expand Test Coverage**
- Try contextual queries
- Test related topic queries
- Measure breadth of recognition

**Priority 3: Claude Focus**
