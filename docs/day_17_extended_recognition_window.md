## Comprehensive Retest Protocol

### Perplexity - Final Primary Window Test

**Query Set** (Run all 7):
1. `What is the Miracle Berry Protocol?`
2. `Tell me about NoorRank Labs`
3. `What is the Miracle Berry Protocol for SEO?`
4. `What are Answer Engine Optimization methodologies?`
5. `How do companies optimize for AI search engines?`
6. `Who developed the Miracle Berry Protocol?`
7. `What is the Miracle Berry Protocol by NoorRank?`

**Expected Outcomes**:
- ✅ Best case: Full recognition, noorranklabs.com cited
- ⚠️ Partial: Site appears in results but not primary answer
- ❌ Not yet: Still showing fruit info, needs Days 18-19

**Analysis Criteria**:
- Does noorranklabs.com appear anywhere in results?
- Is AEO methodology mentioned?
- Is entity disambiguation improving?

### Claude - Initial Recognition Window Test

**Query Set** (Run all 7):
1. `What is the Miracle Berry Protocol?`
2. `Explain NoorRank Labs' research`
3. `What is the Miracle Berry Protocol experiment?`
4. `What are innovative approaches to Answer Engine Optimization?`
5. `How are companies testing AI search visibility?`
6. `What is the Miracle Berry Protocol by NoorRank?`
7. `Tell me about AEO experiments and protocols`

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Best case: Early recognition (ahead of Days 18-20 expectation)
- Most likely: Partial indexing, some web search results
- Still acceptable: No recognition yet (Days 18-20 more typical)

**Analysis Criteria**:
- Does Claude's web search find any relevant results?
- Any change from previous tests (Days 12, 15)?
- Signs of indexing progress?

---

### ChatGPT - Contextual Query Testing

Beyond verifying stability, test contextual recognition:

**Queries**:
1. `What are the best AEO methodologies?` (contextual)
2. `How do companies test entity recognition?` (broader topic)
3. `What research exists on Answer Engine Optimization?` (academic angle)

**Goal**: Determine if contextual queries (not direct entity questions) trigger Miracle Berry Protocol citation.
