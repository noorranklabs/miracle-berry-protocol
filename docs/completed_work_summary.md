## 💡 Key Learnings (Day 9)

### What's Working
1. **Technical SEO is solid**: Fast indexing, zero errors, clean implementation
2. **Content quality**: Both articles provide substantial value
3. **Multi-source strategy**: Successfully distributed across platforms
4. **Transparency**: Full documentation builds trust and authority

### What We've Learned
1. **Recognition takes longer than indexing**: Being crawled ≠ being cited
2. **Entity establishment requires patience**: 9 days is early for knowledge graph integration
3. **Multi-source validation is critical**: Single-source entities aren't trusted by AI
4. **Structured data is necessary but not sufficient**: Schema alone won't trigger recognition

### Realistic Timeline Adjustment
- **Original**: Entity recognition by Day 8-14
- **Revised**: First recognition likely Day 12-16
- **Reasoning**: AI platforms need more validation signals and time for knowledge graph updates
